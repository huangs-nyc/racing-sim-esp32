# About

This project focuses on using ESP32 LILYGO TTGO boards, a joystick, a button, and a potentiometer in order to
create an interactive game, displayed on a laptop screen. This project utilizes Arduino IDE for sensory input
setup and testing, and Processing (file in Java) for running the game.

This game spawns a car on a track, and you must try to keep on the right lane of the track, and
get to the end as fast as possible. There is a speed tracker and a race time tracker on screen as well.
